00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi everyone, I'm Rapha Godinho, creator of Resgatando, which is probably on the channels where you're watching this video.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If you don't know Resgatando, we're a movement, a social project, that was born in 2016, with the goal of increasing the representation of women in school content.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If you want to know more about the story, what we do, I'll leave some links, some suggestions here for content, to read more about this story, because the goal today [interrupted] my cat is sneezing.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Because the goal today is to tell you that yesterday on [interrupted] my God, cat! [resuming] because the goal today is to tell you that yesterday on the twenty-sixth of September of two thousand and twenty-four, we became law. 

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Since two thousand and twenty, Resgatando.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It had been created as a bill. It was being processed in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate and yesterday it received presidential approval.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It was published in the Official Gazette and, starting next year, it will come into effect in a practical way, in public and private elementary schools throughout the country, and it is very important for us.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It is super significant to know that we have reached this point where an idea I had when I was sixteen, which I thought I would solve by sticking poster board on the wall, has become a law at the national level in Brazil.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, of course, the hassle I had in starting the project is not enough for us to have an initiative like this, which will generate impact and everything.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So, I would also like to take this opportunity to share with you why, right?

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Because sometimes people, especially now that it has become a law and everything, tend to think that it is a political movement or something along those lines.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And here I emphasize that we have been working, rescuing ourselves, regardless of my personal ideologies.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We have been working, rescuing ourselves since 2016.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So you see that we have gone through three governments since then, at the federal level, always with this line of trying to implement this.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
At the Brazilian state level, right?

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Our objective was not in any way to present this as a political project, but rather as an educational project, to really impact schools in general in Brazil, just like the similar projects that we had approved in 2018, 2016. But anyway, before talking about that, I just wanted to share with you a little bit of why.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The project is important from the sources we took, because it wasn't voices in my head that said, "Oh, come on, let's study more women in school."

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes. There really is more basis for this!

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:40,000
From the studies that made us focus on this the most. It was the main study. It was published by Anne Shiponda and Johan Westermann. Well, it's public on Scielo. 

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But basically they do a survey on the global representation of women in school content texts. How present are they?

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Since there is usually a lot of representation of gender stereotypes, or how are they, generally in isolated blocks, right?

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then one thing they mention that is very interesting is that women are generally marginalized, underrepresented or even excluded in school content, right?

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So, I'm reading some excerpts from the research here, but then they present it as a solution to the problem.

24
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This text from 2011 says that the path forward must move towards a history that includes women, as well as other marginalized groups.

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So, here they talk little about this importance and talk about how much this exclusion happens on a global level.

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's also worth mentioning that, as I mentioned, Resgatar has been going on since 2016 and in the meantime we have encouraged and inspired initiatives in other parts of the world.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
In some Brazilian cities, this practice really does exist.

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So it's quite interesting.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And there's another study, which I think is the cherry on the cake, for us to understand the issue because there we saw that, well, there aren't many women in school content, it would be interesting if we had, but now speaking of practical aspects, we bring another study.

30
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This one was published by the journal Science, but it's also available on Scielo and it was done by Lin Bian, Sarah-Jane Leslie and Andrei Cimpian.

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's basically material that followed the development of several children in schools of school age 
and from a certain point on, the girls start to feel less involved.

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They are less likely to participate in activities for people they consider very, very intelligent.

33
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And boys aren't. 

34
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Especially when we talk about activities, games related to exact sciences, subjects, etc.

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And another thing that is very interesting is that I will read an excerpt from this research, 
which says the following: common stereotypes associate high-level intellectual ability, brilliance, genius, etc. with men.

36
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
More than women, these stereotypes discourage women from seeking prestigious careers.

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That is, women are underrepresented in fields whose members value brilliance, such as philosophy, etc.

38
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Here in the research, we show that these stereotypes are endorsed and influence the interests of children as young as six years old.

39
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Specifically, six-year-old girls are less likely than boys to believe that members of their gender are quote very, very intelligent, unquote.

40
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Also at age six, girls begin to avoid activities that are said to be for very, very smart kids.

41
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
These findings suggest that notions of gender and brilliance are acquired early and have an immediate effect on children's interests.

42
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So, it's a school necessity that we're going to achieve.

43
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
For example, that girls engage in more activities.

44
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That boys can see girls too.

45
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
As agents of this brilliance, right?

46
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
or capable of going into certain areas.

47
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Of course, today we already see a very significant change, very significant in this, 
but here we're talking about basic education. That's why it's so important to have these examples and to have women being studied, right?

48
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
To have examples of women in philosophy, mathematics, biology, philosophy?

49
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Not only as .

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
exception block over there.

51
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But really, as parts of world history.

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And here are some other important data to bring to you. They are not from these surveys, but from other sources, 
one from Plan International, which was also a sponsor of Resgatando, one of our activities. 
A few years ago, they said that forty percent of Brazilian girls between the ages of six and fourteen do not think they are as intelligent as boys.

53
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's another point here.

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Another piece of information is that it is brought by a very interesting report.

55
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is from two thousand and sixteen, from Folha.

56
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I can even include all the links.

57
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Actually, what I'm commenting on, I'll leave it here for your information, 
is that from the moment we enter puberty, female participation in mathematical activities decreases.

58
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So, they are less involved in this universe.

59
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And here I bring another one that is according to the fact that women are fifty percent more likely to leave careers in science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics than men, according to this organization of the year that I will bring here.

60
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Later for you.

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So, just to show that Wow, it is an important topic, it is a relevant topic.

62
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We do not get it out of our heads that it is important to study women, 
that it is important to have this issue and this motivation within the school environment.

63
7:01: These studies that I showed you, some of them talk specifically about school content, others talk specifically about school life, others are sources, a few more variables that bring this perspective into Brazil.

64
7:11: But they all end up going along the same line of reasoning that we need to be.

65
7:15: EH We need to change the way we do education in Brazil.

66
7:18: If we want to have greater involvement of girls in some activities, it's in general and also of boys, right?

67
7:25: This change in perception itself.

68
7:28: And then another thing that's also cool to talk about here with you is that we're bringing it back.

69
7:33: Today we also have an online portal where we have.

70
7:36: It's mainly for teachers, but it also serves parents who might want to use this engagement with their children at home.

71
7:44: But we have a portal that I'll also link here, where you have a small database of historical women that you can filter by area of ​​expertise.

72
7:51: So, for example, I'm a Brazilian history teacher and I want to bring some references to women in my class, I don't know, about the colonial period. You can use our filters there to bring this information, as well as in other fields as well.

73
8:04: But another cool thing is, why don't we feed this database more?

74
8:07: We're in the process of doing that.

75
8:09: But today we're in the era of artificial intelligence.

76
8:13: About a year ago, I tested GPT to see how it was doing in this issue of bringing in sources of historical women.

77
8:19: And he wasn't very mature, but we know that, right?

78
8:22: That it's just a matter of learning.

79
8:24: And then, in the meantime, a lot has changed.

80
8:27: So, if you ask ChatGPT, for example, it's always very specific, right guys?

81
8:32: We know how this artificial intelligence works, that it needs to provide specifications and everything.

82
8:36: But if you ask for summaries of stories about specific women, it can already give you a certain amount of accuracy, just like if you ask for summaries like these filters, right?

83
8:44: So, for example, give me the biography of a woman from the countryside, from mathematical science in a specific area or give me the story of Hedy Llamar. Anyway, today ChatGPT is mature enough to be able to do this and of course that's also our job.

84
9:03: Ensure that this information is true.

85
9:07: That's it.

86
9:08: I just wanted to share this information with you, which is very significant, to remind you of those who follow it.

87
9:12: I've had a hard time lately, I've had some personal problems. I lost my mother to Burkitt's Lymphoma four months ago.

88
9:18: It's been almost a year and a half of intense struggle to deal with this issue.

89
9:26: And that's it?

90
9:28: So I wanted to officially come here to share this news with you. I'm not as emotional as I was yesterday, when I was in tears, but my eyes are swollen, which shows that I was in tears.

91
9:37: And finally, I'm available to provide more information about this, to clarify more texts of the law.

92
9:44: And another point that is super important to mention is that this law follows the same path as two other laws that we had in 2008 and 2003.

93
9:52: To talk about the issue of indigenous history in 2003, about the history of black culture in Brazil.

94
9:58: The only thing that really differs is that here we talk about history, about women in general.

95
10:02: But we also talk about historical women, so personalities, in a centralized way, and it is always important for us to monitor, see and validate how these are being applied.

96
10:11: As I said, there are laws that have "adulthood", right?

97
10:14: It's been over twenty years since its creation and we know that it's still not in a very ideal territory for what we need for this type of legislation in Brazil, but they exist. They motivate teachers' work, motivate parents' and students' work.

98
10:29: So it's important for us to continue monitoring these laws.

99
10:33: And it's also important to know that when we talk about this inclusion of women's history, this project, it's totally linked to these laws from 2008 and 2003, so we also come to work.

100
10:43: The history of indigenous women, the history of black women in Brazil and in the world.

101
10:46: Well, anyway, rescuing it. There's content on social media, podcasts, databases so you can learn about historical women.

102
10:54: If you want, we have book recommendations, we have everything.

103
10:57: Guys, there's everything, but that's what I told you.

104
10:59: We also have ChatGPT today, very well formalized to provide this information now in 2024, and a simple Google search on any online search engine, and you can also get more information.

105
11:11: But we know that there's still a lot to finish.

106
11:13: So, I hope you'll join us on this journey to rescue and value the great women in the history of Brazil and the world.

107
11:22: And that's it?

108
11:23: [speeded up] Rapha, sixteen years old.

109
11:24: Who put posters on the school wall, selling his books to buy supplies.

110
11:26: To do the project, your idea became law, my dear, your idea became law, congratulations!
